# Mathematics goes through Wolfram. Mandatory.

Drake, 2026-10-25: every agent uses Wolfram for mathematics. Not mental arithmetic, not an ad-hoc script,
not a spreadsheet cell, not a number produced by fluency.

## What is in scope

- Any computation, derivation, integral, series, solve, simplification, identity check, dimensional
  analysis, unit conversion, statistical calculation, tolerance, expected value or numeric constant.
- Any number you are about to put in a report, receipt, PR body, gate, evidence file or user answer.
- Checking a formula that code implements against its symbolic form.
- The physics behind a visual or a claim, not only the arithmetic of the numbers already measured.

Not in scope: a number that is already measured and filed with its source (quote it with the source);
integer bookkeeping such as line counts, byte sizes, exit codes, PIDs and commit shas.

## Tools in this harness

Mounted as MCP tools by the hosted service `https://agenttools.wolfram.com/mcp`:

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `mcp__wolfram_wolframlanguageevaluator` | Wolfram Language evaluation. Exact results: `Integrate`, `Solve`, `Reduce`, `Series`, `D`, `Simplify`, `Quantity`, `UnitConvert`, `NIntegrate` |
| `mcp__wolfram_wolframalpha` | Natural-language facts, constants, identities and conversions when you do not want to write code |
| `mcp__wolfram_wolframcontext` | Semantic retrieval for background on a term |

## Setup, so no human has to be involved

1. **Check the mount.** `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` must contain:

   ```json
   "wolfram": { "type": "http", "url": "https://agenttools.wolfram.com/mcp", "timeout": 120000 }
   ```

   This transport needs **no token, no local Wolfram Engine and no npm package** on the project machine.
   Verified 2026-10-25 by two calls: `Integrate[x^2, {x, 0, 1}]` returned `1/3`, and `sqrt(27)/2`
   returned `(3 sqrt(3))/2`.
2. **If the tools are missing**, add that block and restart the session. MCP servers mount at session
   start, so a running session cannot pick up the new block. Do not install a local Wolfram Engine to
   satisfy this rule: the hosted endpoint is the supported path.
3. **If the endpoint demands credentials** (another machine, a changed policy), the secret lives in the
   vault and is injected at launch, for example `atlas-vault run CORTEX_TOKEN -- <server>`. Never write
   a token into `mcp.json`, a repository file, a commit or a log.
4. **Verify before claiming the session is math-capable.** Two calls: the evaluator above and one
   WolframAlpha fact. If either fails, the session is not math-capable: say so and stop. Do not compute
   by hand as a workaround.

## How to use it

- One call per question, and quote the query with the result where the work lives:
  `WolframLanguageEvaluator: Integrate[x^2, {x, 0, 1}] -> 1/3`.
- Prefer exact results. Take `N[...]` only when a decimal is what the reader needs, and say which form
  you used. `Quantity` and `UnitConvert` carry the unit into the text; a bare number without a unit is
  not a result.
- When Wolfram contradicts the code, the code is wrong until shown otherwise. Record both and open the
  investigation instead of picking the friendlier number.
- Wolfram is the calculator, not a receipt: the project's MODELED versus MEASURED labels are unchanged,
  and a Wolfram result does not show that a modelled mechanism runs on the hardware.

## Failure modes

- **Tools absent**: the session is not math-capable. Report it. Never improvise arithmetic.
- **401 or 403**: credential wiring. Fix or report it; it is not a reason to skip the mathematics.
- **Timeout**: retry once with a smaller query; if it still fails, report the exact query and error.
- **A result you cannot interpret**: ask again in explicit form (`Solve`, `Reduce`, `Assuming`) and
  report the ambiguity rather than rounding it away.

## Why it is mandatory

Hand arithmetic and invented constants are the most common silent error in agent work, and they survive
review because they look reasonable. A symbolic or numeric check is cheap, reproducible and quotable.
